# Netflix-Data-Analysis | Tableau
I downloaded the data from Kaggle the data which is of 303 Emloyees Working in a Software Company and as a Data Aalyst I am supposed to analyze this data thoroughly and give to give answers to few important questions.

I have loaded this available data into SQL and have performed (Extract/Load/Transform) ELT on data I have extracted answers to few important question which were asked to me (mentioned below) then I have transformed data by altering columns deleting some unwanted columns.
After deleting unwanted entries:

Questions
1.	Find the relationship  between Movies and TV Shows?
2.	Total Movies and TV Shows by Year?
